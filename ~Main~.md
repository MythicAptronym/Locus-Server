# __Secure Communication__

This is a guide for how to set up secure, self-hosted communication, including text, voice, and video chat, which is much more difficult\* for governments to surveil than typical texts or social media (such as Facebook, Discord, Tumblr, etc). The Signal app is an easier secure communication alternative to use and highly recommended. However, [China has blocked Signal](https://www.techradar.com/news/china-blocks-signal-heres-what-you-need-to-know), making impossible to access without a VPN (service which alters your apparent digital location) which [China has also been cracking down on](https://www.farwestchina.com/tips/best-vpn-for-china/). Such services can be interfered with and censored by governments.

A self-hosted communication system is much more difficult to interfere with or ban. It is the goal of this project to enable oppressed and at-risk groups, such as queer people and ethnic minorities, to communicate securely without fear of surveillance, censorship, or government violence. 

\*No form of communication, online or otherwise, is definitively secure. This will not protect you from the [FBI installing spyware onto your computer](https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna3341694) and using that to gain access to your secure communication URL and account. However it's infinitely more secure than communicating on Discord, which can and does cooperate with government requests to access user messages and other data.

As a perk, it so happens that the process to do so also lends itself to setting up a full home server with self-hosted cloud storage, which can save a good deal of money on cloud storage and avoid dependence on data-mining entities such as Google and Apple to store one's files. This guide can also be used to do that. If you use this guide to do so, even if you yourself have no need for secure communication, please consider passing it on to those in your life who may be the targets of bigotry and institutional violence. 

Even if they don't end up needing or using it, gestures such as these, reaching out and affirming a desire to help, are never without merit or appreciation. 

### __To-Do List__

 4. Install the imaging software. [Software Download List](https://storage.quietstars.org/f/272237)
    1. (Beginner) There are prepared images (copies of everything needed to make your Pi a computer with software) and scripts (little programs which will ask you for your inputs) which will let you set everything up painlessly. You will only need to type in things like your wifi name and password, your desired usernames and passwords, your domain name, etc.
    2. (Advanced) There is a list of tools and instructions with which you can install a fresh Raspberry Pi OS and add everything you need.
 5. Image your Micro SD Card.
 6. Assemble your Raspberry Pi.
 7. Install the SSH software (this lets your computer talk to other computers). Log into your Pi and complete the installation.
 8. Set up your Databag server. 
 9. (For full home server users). Set up your Nextcloud system.
10. Talk to your friends and say hi to others.
