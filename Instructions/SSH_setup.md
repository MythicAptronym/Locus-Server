# __SSH Setup__

To-do: Include instructions for Macs and Ubuntu.

SSH means "Secure Shell", referring to the Secure Shell Protocol. An SSH program (like PuTTY) lets you talk to your Pi from your computer in a secure way. If you are using Windows, download and install [PuTTY](Software_Repository/SSH.md). Make sure to create a desktop shortcut for PuTTY, and open it up.

In a previous step you create a Pi hostname, Pi username, and Pi password. Make sure you have all three ready for this step.

In the field for `Host Name (or IP address)`, enter your Pi hostname, followed by ".local". So like this `[exampleHostname].local`. This will take you to a mostly black window with only text saying `login as:`. Enter your Pi username and press Enter. Enter your Pi password (no text will appear, this is a normal security measure) and press Enter.
