# __CasaOS Setup__

If typing into the terminal window was intimidating, don't worry! We exactly have one more line to enter. Type the following line into terminal and press Enter. A lot of text will start scrolling. Wait for this to finish.

Note: Terminal windows often do not accept `ctrl+v` commands to paste content. If you want to paste the following command, you may have to right-click in the terminal window (on some systems this automatically pastes text) or right-click and select paste.

1. `curl -fsSL https://get.casaos.io | sudo bash`

This commands installs [CasaOS](https://casaos.io/) from an online repository, and a lot of text will scroll by while it installs. CasaOS is an operating system which sits on top of your Raspberry Pi OS. It lets you operate your Pi through a graphics-based desktop like your usual computers, rather than through a terminal, and lets us easily make use of many programs written by open-source programmers. As a quick note, we have a [list of open-source programers whose work we'd like you to consider supporting](../donations_list.md). Their hard work makes all of this possible and they rely on donations to continue doing this work. The whole world benefits from the labor of open source programmers. (The comic below is not a joke. It is stone-cold reality.)
