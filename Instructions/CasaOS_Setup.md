# __CasaOS Setup__

If typing into the Terminal window was intimidating, don't worry! We only have one more line to enter. Type the following line into Terminal and press Enter. A lot of text will start scrolling as CasaOS installs. Wait for this to finish.

Note: Terminal windows often do not accept `ctrl+v` commands to paste content. If you want to paste the following command, you may have to right-click (on some systems this automatically pastes text) or right-click and select paste.

`curl -fsSL https://get.casaos.io | sudo bash`
