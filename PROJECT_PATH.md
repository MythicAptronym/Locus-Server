## Two OS choices:
- Raspberry Pi OS, Debian Bullseye, no desktop
- - Put CasoOS on top of this for full home server
- - No Databag with this option, I'm pretty sure
- DietPi OS, Bullseye, no desktop
- - Extremely low profile OS, looks super useful, but I had trouble getting Nextcloud Talk to work on it, and the Databag install seems busted
 
## Two end to end encryption options:
- [Databag](https://github.com/balzack/databag?tab=readme-ov-file)
- - Lower profile program than Nextcloud Talk.
- [Nextcloud Talk](https://nextcloud.com/talk/)
- - Meshes easily with Nextcloud for home servers
- - I got it to run for a bit on the Pi Zero 2 W, didn't burn out. Not sure if that would hold for a long time though.
 
## Tutorial Elements
- Equipment list
- Software list
- Domain name details
- Installation details
- Troubleshooting docs
- GUI and operation details
- "What can you do with this" walkthroughs
- User manuals for non-hosters
- - These need to be *extremely* low-level
- References list for more technically adept users
- Video guides?

Key goal: Offload as much of the installation onto scripts and images as possible.
